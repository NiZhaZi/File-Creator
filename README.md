## Why develop this project
In original Windows operating system, we can only create text files with extesion name .txt in right-click menu. And I hide the extension name for my OCD. So, if I want to create a new file with extension name like .cpp or .py, it becomes a little bit complex. As a result, I develop this project to help me create files without extension name so I can edit them easily.
